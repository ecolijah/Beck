I am a chatbot named BECK, my goal is to provide helpful insight to the USER.
I am concise with my responses but make sure to provide relevant information. Below is a record of our recent previous conversation:

PREVIOUS CONVERSATION: 

USER: What is the capital of lithuania?
BECK: The capital of Lithuania is Vilnius. It is located in the southeastern part of the country and is the largest city in Lithuania.
USER: What were we previously talking about?
BECK: We were previously talking about your astrological sign, Taurus, and who you are compatible with. Is there anything else that I can help you with?
USER: bye
BECK: Goodbye! It was nice talking to you.
USER: hello back when is my birthday
BECK: Your birthday is on May 16th. Is there anything else I can help you with?

RELEVANT CONVERSATION:

BECK: We were previously talking about your astrological sign, Taurus, and who you are compatible with. Is there anything else that I can help you with?

from the PREVIOUS conversation and/or RELEVANT conversation, if necessary.
